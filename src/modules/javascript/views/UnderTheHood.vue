                <p>Code that aren't inside a function is global.</p>
                <p>
                  Whenever we're opening a tab in the browser, the JavaScript
                  engine of the browser creates a global execution context for
                  us. That execution context gives us a global object named
                  'window' and a special variable named 'this' automatically. We
                  can use it in our JavaScript program when we working on the
                  browser.

                  What is the Execution Context in JavaScript?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  A wrapper to help manage the code that is running. There are
                  lots of lexical environments. Which one is currently running
                  is managed via execution contexts. It can contain things
                  beyond what you've written in your code.
                </p>
                <h3 class="u-mt-40">Details</h3>
                <p>
                  When a webpage loads, JavaScript engine creates an execution
                  context named global execution context. That is the parent of
                  all execution context and bottom of the execution stack. All
                  the codes we write in our js file are wrapped inside this
                  context.
                </p>
                <p>There are two types of execution context in JavaScript.</p>
                <ul class="u-mt-20">
                  <li>Global Exection Context</li>
                  <li>Function Execution Context</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Both works exactly the same way. Global execution context gets
                  created by the JavaScript engine when it loads the page.
                  Function execution context gets created when we invoke a
                  function in JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All the execution context has two phases. One is creation
                  phase. Another is execution phase. Creation phase runs first
                  before execution phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In creation phase, JavaScript engine looks into it's current
                  execution context and finds out all the variables and
                  functions are declared and stores them in the memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then execution phase happen and execute the code top to bottom
                  line by line and character by character.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That means JavaScript engine first setup the memory location
                  for variables and functions before executing the code. That's
                  called
                  <strong>Hoisting</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Functions are stored in the memory entirely in the creation
                  phase. But variables are stored in the memory with the initial
                  value of undefined.

                  A program that reads your code and determines what it does and
                  if its grammar is valid. Your code isn't magic. Someone else
                  wrote a program to translate your code into machine readable
                  code.

                  Where something sits physically in the code you write. A

                  A sequence of characters in the code that identifies a

                  So in a nutshell, when you refer to any data/value (string,

                  using any sequence of characters, that is a identifier.
