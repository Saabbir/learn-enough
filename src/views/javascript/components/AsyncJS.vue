        <p>Asynchronous simply means more than one at a time.</p>
        <h3 class="u-middle-el">Details</h3>
        <p>
          When we're talking about running JavaScript, the JavaScript engine itself, we understand it
          doesn't exist by itself inside for example in internet browser. JavaScript engine isn't the
          only engine in the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other engines and running pieces of code that are happening outside the JavaScript
          engine that runs JavaScript when you loaded in to the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the engines running asynchronously inside the browser but what's happening inside the
          JavaScript engine it's synchronous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose when we click on something in the browser that is an event. The click event. The
          browser is going to place that click event on the event queue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Question: When is JavaScript engine going to look at that queue and proceed? Answer: After all
          the current execution context is complete. Because the JavaScript engine won't look at the
          event queue untill the execution stack is empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any events that happened outside of the JavaScript engine get placed into that queue and if
          execution stack is empty if JavaScript isn't working on anything else currently it will
          process those events and process those events in the order they happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asynchronous callbacks are possible in JavaScript but the asynchronous part is really what
          happening outside the JavaScript engine. Events in JavaScript happen asynchronously.
